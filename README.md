# Note-Taker

## Description

Different people has various way to take note according to their preference. There is no absolute the best way for specific people to take note. Whatever method they get most usded to is the best for themselves. In this project, I am creating an application that can be used to write, save, edit and delete notes. This application will use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

Here is how the application made of:
* Landing Page with start button
* Note Page with two main columns:
    * The left column is the list of saved note with edit and delete functions
    * The right column is the note taking area with view and edit functions
* API JSON data page to store all the saved data in JSON format
